As a fun fact, the tool which I used to find the location of IP Address defaults to Chinese address if the ip address is private.

- This code also requires ipinfo and traceroute which can be easily installed for your OS.
- IPinfo CLI installation can be found [here](https://github.com/ipinfo/cli)
> [!IMPORTANT]
> Run the code with isVis argument(2nd arg in generateTable fn) as False if you dont want geolocation visualizations
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
python3 traceroute.py
```
